# Results Ledger

This file is the compact source of truth for what this repository currently
claims, what it has only tested numerically, and what remains open.

## Certified Results

### Lemma: pairwise circle-intersection cap

Status: proved.

In any true counterexample, for distinct centers `a,b`,
`|S_a cap S_b| <= 2`. Otherwise two distinct circles would share at least
three points.

### Lemma: incidence counting gives n >= 7

Status: proved.

The directed 4-out incidence pattern and the pairwise cap imply no
counterexample can have `n <= 6`; the convexity-of-indegree count gives
`n >= 7`.

### Theorem: selected-witness incidence rules out n <= 7

Status: proved and reproducible.

The incidence count rules out `n <= 6`. For `n=7`, equality forces all
indegrees to be 4 and every pair of selected 4-sets to intersect in exactly
2 points. The complements `T_i = V \ S_i` form Fano lines with `i in T_i`.

The exact enumerator checks all 30 labelled Fano planes and 720 pointed
equality families, reducing them to 54 cyclic-dihedral classes. In every
family, the common-witness chord map has cycle type `7+7+7`, so the required
radical-axis perpendicularity constraints contain odd cycles. This obstructs
all `n=7` selected-witness equality patterns. See
`docs/n7-fano-enumeration.md`.

## Numerical Attempts

### B12_3x4_danzer_lift

Status: near-miss degeneration, rejected as counterexample.

Diagnostics:

- max selected-distance spread: `0.006806368780585714`
- RMS equality residual: `0.0019599509549614457`
- convexity margin: `9.999999943508973e-07`
- minimum edge length: `0.0007465865604262556`
- verifier status at tolerance `1e-6`: rejected

Interpretation:

The residual improves as the polygon approaches a three-cluster degeneration.
This is evidence about a failed route, not a solution.

## Open Subproblems

1. Prove or refute degeneration for `B12_3x4_danzer_lift`.
2. Run a `B20_4x5_FR_lift` anti-clustering margin sweep.
3. Add interval-arithmetic verification for convexity and distance equations.
4. Strengthen the incidence SAT/SMT abstraction beyond the pairwise cap.
